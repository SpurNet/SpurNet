 6. Core Features
6.1 Smart Contracts and Token Standards
Java Smart Contract (JSC)
SynergyChain supports multiple token standards, including SCA10, SCA20, SCA721, SCA1155, etc. These standards are implemented on the SynergyChain platform in the form of Java smart contracts. Developers can use the Java language to develop and deploy token contracts according to these standards.
· SCA10 Standard
· Purpose: Dedicated token standard for stablecoins and legal tender.
· Functions: Supports freezing, burning, minting, permission management, and other advanced features to meet regulatory and compliance requirements.
· Advantages: Special mechanisms within the JVM, bound to asset security attributes, provide higher security and performance through secure wallet locking, suitable for financial scenarios with extremely high security requirements.
· SCA20 Standard
· Purpose: General token standard widely used in various DApp development.
· Functions: Provides standard interfaces such as transfer, authorization, balance inquiry.
· Advantages: By implementing SCA20 using JSC, it supports the creation, issuance, and management of tokens.
· SCA721 Standard
· Purpose: Non·Fungible Token (NFT) standard used for unique digital assets.
· Functions: Supports uniqueness identification, metadata storage, ownership transfer.
· Advantages: By using JSC to implement SCA721 standard contracts, it meets the needs of digital collectibles, game props, and other application scenarios.
· SCA1155 Standard
· Purpose: Multi·token standard supporting both fungible and non·fungible tokens.
· Functions: Optimizes batch operations, reduces transaction costs.
· Advantages: Suitable for games and digital asset platforms, enhancing operational efficiency.
Note: Although standards like SCA20, SCA721, and SCA1155 are functionally similar to Ethereum's ERC standards, they are not directly compatible. Developers need to rewrite contract code on the SynergyChain platform using Java according to the JSC framework. Providing these token standards similar to Ethereum's ERC standards lowers the learning curve for developers, making it easier to migrate or implement existing DApps and token concepts onto SynergyChain.
6.2 Secure Wallet Mechanism
To ensure user asset security, SynergyChain has designed a comprehensive secure wallet architecture, implemented in Java, and provides functions for interacting with wallets at the smart contract level.
Secure Wallet Architecture
1. Secure Wallet (Vault)
· Function: Stores the user's main funds with the highest security level. Typically not used for daily transactions to reduce exposure to risks.
· Implementation:
· Multi·Signature Mechanism: Using Java·written smart contracts, users can add multi·signature functionality, requiring multiple private key signatures for critical asset transfer operations.
· Permission Control: Set permissions through smart contracts so that only specific addresses or contracts can call sensitive methods.
· Authorization Limits: Define daily or per·transaction limits in contracts; operations exceeding the limit require additional verification.
2. Sub·Wallet (Interaction Specific)
· Function: Used for daily transactions and interactions, operating flexibly within authorized limits.
· Implementation:
· Automated Operations: The sub·wallet's private key is usually stored in the application to automatically sign transactions. Java's security library `KeyStore` can manage this securely.
· Security Restrictions: The sub·wallet typically handles small amounts or low·risk transactions in smart contracts; larger transactions require authorization from the secure wallet or disabling the fund protection mode.
Universal Account Model
1. Public Key Field
· Purpose: Users can log in to applications supporting the SynergyChain network using their public key without exposing their private key.
· Implementation:
· Login Mechanism: Applications receive the user's public key and verify its validity by calling blockchain APIs.
· Secondary Verification: Generate dynamic verification codes by encrypting and hashing the public key, integrating into two·factor authentication.
· Permission Restrictions: At the smart contract level, restrict accounts using only public keys to perform non·fund operations like queries.
2. Private Key Field
· Purpose: Users needing to perform fund operations must import their private key into the application.
· Implementation:
· Private Key Management: Use Java's encryption library to encrypt and store the private key, preventing plaintext leakage.
· Transaction Signing: Decrypt the private key when executing transactions and use it to sign the transaction.
Fund Protection Mode
1. Enable Fund Security Protection
· Mechanism: Through smart contract settings, when the sub·wallet receives SCA10 assets (stablecoins or legal tender), all SCA10 assets go directly into the secure wallet.
· Implementation:
· Contract Filtering: Restrict the sub·wallet from receiving specific types of tokens in the contract.
· Automatic Transfer: When the sub·wallet receives SCA10 assets, the smart contract automatically transfers them to the secure wallet.
2. Non·Fund Protection Mode
· Mechanism: The sub·wallet can directly hold all types of funds for daily interactions without authorization from the secure wallet.
· Implementation:
· Remove Restrictions: Allow the sub·wallet to receive all types of tokens in the contract.
· Risk Prompt: Prompt users in the application that enabling this mode may pose security risks.
Interaction with Smart Contracts
· Call Smart Contract Methods: Use the Java SDK to call smart contract methods, such as authorizing sub·wallets or setting limits.
· Listen to Contract Events: Applications can listen to events triggered by smart contracts to respond to fund changes or permission modifications.
· Security Verification: Use multi·signature and permission verification when executing contract methods involving fund operations to ensure only authorized actions succeed.
Security Considerations
· Fund Security: Use hardware wallets or secure chips to prevent private key theft.
· Network Security: Use HTTPS or other encryption protocols when communicating with blockchain nodes to prevent hijacking.
· Input Validation: Strictly validate user inputs and transaction parameters to prevent injection attacks or malicious data.
· Exception Handling: Capture and handle all exceptions to prevent system crashes or vulnerabilities due to unhandled exceptions.
6.3 Economic Model and Incentive Mechanisms
Developer Incentives
· Mechanism: 50% of the Gas fees from each contract interaction are directly allocated to the corresponding application developers.
· Advantages: Provides developers with a continuous income source, incentivizing high·quality DApp development and maintenance.
· Management: Developers can set beneficiary addresses through smart contracts for automatic revenue distribution and management.
Validator Incentives
· Mechanism: Validators stake a certain amount of tokens to participate in consensus and receive rewards and transaction fees when successfully validating new blocks.
· Reward Calculation: Calculated using linear or weighted algorithms based on the staked amount and validation behavior.
· Penalty Mechanism: Dishonest or offline validators risk having a portion of their staked tokens slashed.
Advantages of Low Transaction Fees and Fast Confirmation
· Low Transaction Fees: Optimized network protocols and consensus algorithms reduce resource consumption in transaction processing, lowering user fees.
· Fast Confirmation Speed: Average block generation time of 2 seconds, using efficient network transmission and consensus mechanisms to ensure quick confirmations.
 7. SynergyChain Architecture Design and Technological Innovations
