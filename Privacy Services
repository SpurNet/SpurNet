 Privacy Services and Technical Support

As time goes on, users are becoming increasingly concerned about privacy and data security. However, many platforms, overwhelmed by their massive databases, fail to address these privacy concerns adequately.

At SpurNet, we prioritize user privacy by implementing decentralized identity (DID) and third party KYC verification to ensure the safety of user data and prevent privacy breaches.

 Decentralized Identity (DID)
· Users generate a decentralized identity (DID), which is managed and controlled by the users themselves.
· Identity information is stored either on the user's device or on a distributed network, ensuring privacy and security.
· For transactions and usage, users only need to provide their DID for authentication, without sharing personal data.

 Third·Party KYC Verification
· In situations that require KYC verification, SpurNet directs users to a third·party partner for identity verification.
· After successful verification, only the encrypted KYC result is shared with SpurNet, while the third party manages and stores the KYC data, ensuring that user information remains secure.

By integrating DID and third·party KYC verification, users maintain full control over their personal identity information, safeguarding their privacy and addressing the privacy vulnerabilities of traditional Web2 models.

SpurNet's privacy protection policy promotes the decentralization of user data, imposing strict measures to prevent data misuse and fraud.
