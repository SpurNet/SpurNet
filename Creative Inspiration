How to Earn Creative Revenue on SpurNet

SpurNet provides diverse revenue opportunities for creators, whether it's book creation, artwork, art pieces, code, tutorial sharing, or video creation, all of which can be monetized on the SpurNet platform.

Basic Process for Earning Revenue

First, creators need to publish their works on a platform that supports content creation.

· Book Creation:
· If you publish a book on an online reading platform, you can choose to make it paid or free to read.
· For paid content, users can view the work after paying the set fee, and the revenue will be shared according to the platform's policies.
· For free books, users must sign a confirmation before reading, which incurs a small gas fee, of which 50% will be your revenue. This is similar to earning through click rates.

· Artwork and Art Pieces:
· You can create artwork in the form of NFTs and sell it through your own platform or third·party platforms. All sales proceeds belong to the creator, but using third·party platforms may incur additional transaction fees.
· You can also provide your artwork as free material on resource websites, where users must pay a gas fee before downloading to prevent bot abuse, with 50% of the fee going to you.
· Additionally, you can entrust your art pieces to third·party platforms for custody and convert them into NFTs of equivalent value for sale.

· Code, Tutorial Sharing, and Books:
· You can choose to make code, tutorials, and similar content either paid or free to access, with users paying the respective fee to view paid content.
· You can also entrust these contents to third·party platforms as free resources. Users must pass bot verification and pay a gas fee before downloading, with 50% of the fee going to the creator.
· You can also earn revenue through paid questions, paid answers, and offering rewards for answers.

· Video Creation and Other Types of Creation:
· Video creators and other types of creators can earn revenue through the following methods:
1. User tips
2. Users offering rewards for answers
3. Attracting a large following through quality content, which in turn draws third·party advertising and product promotions, earning commissions from sales.
