How to Earn Creative Revenue on SpurNet

SpurNet provides various opportunities for creators to earn revenue, whether it's book creation, artwork, art pieces, code, tutorial sharing, or video creation. All types of creative work can be monetized on SpurNet.

 Basic Process for Earning Revenue

First, your creative work needs to be published on a platform that supports content creation.

· Book Creation:
  · If you publish a book on an online reading platform, you can choose to make it paid or free to read.
  · For paid content, users can view your work after paying the set fee. Revenue from paid content will be shared according to the policies of the platform you are using.
  · For free books, users need to sign a confirmation before reading, which incurs a small gas fee, of which 50% will be your income. This is similar to earning through click rates.

· Artwork and Art Pieces:
  · You can create artwork in the form of NFTs and sell it through your own platform or third·party platforms. All sales proceeds will belong to you, but note that using third·party platforms may incur additional transaction fees.
  · You can also provide your artwork as free material on resource websites. Users will need to pay a gas fee before downloading to prevent bot attacks, and 50% of this fee will be your income.
  · Additionally, you can entrust your art pieces to a third·party platform for custody, which will convert your art into NFTs of equivalent value for sale.

· Code, Tutorial Sharing, and Books:
  · You can choose to make code, tutorials, and similar content either paid or free. Users need to pay the respective fee to access paid content.
  · Similar to artwork, you can also entrust these types of content to third·party platforms to be offered for free. Users will need to pass a bot verification and pay a gas fee before downloading, of which 50% will go to the creator.
  · You can also earn revenue through paid questions, paid answers, and offering rewards for answers.

· Video Creation and Other Types of Creation:
  · Video creators and other types of creators can earn revenue through the following methods:
    1. User tips
    2. Users offering rewards for questions
    3. Attracting a large following through quality content, which in turn draws third·party advertising and product promotions, earning commission from sales.
